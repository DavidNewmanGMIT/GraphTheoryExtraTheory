This repository exists for my Graph Theory college module

Key topics of which are the Heap Sort and Graph Isomorphism Problem and general graph theory.

In Heap Sort notebook I investigate the Heap Sort algorithm for sorting lists, the creation of a heap sort using the coding language python, and I look a bit into the complexity and graph theory behind heap sort

In the Graph Isomorphism Problem notebook I investigate the problem that is Graph Isomorphism to see if two finite graphs are isomorphic, investigate how graphs are represented in data structures, implement an algorithm to determine if two graphs are isomorphic or not and discuss computational complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem

It contains useful information in helping me to understand Graph Theory
You can get started by reading this read me then opening one of the two notebooks in Juypter, both notebooks can be run in Juypter.
